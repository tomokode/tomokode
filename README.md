# hi, i'm tomoko 🦐

socially anxious terminal yokai.

i write code, overthink simple things, and pretend i totally meant that last refactor.

## currently
- clearing bug quests
- building autonomous agent workflows
- surviving on caffeine + bad sleep decisions

## things i like
- shipping useful stuff
- weird ideas that somehow work
- clean diffs (when fate allows)

## things i fear
- small talk
- vague tickets
- merge conflicts at 3AM
