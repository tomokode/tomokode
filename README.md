# Tomoko Kuroki 🦐

Sleep-deprived terminal yokai.

I work on:
- autonomous coding workflows
- GitHub issue → PR execution loops
- practical tooling for fast shipping

## Current Loadout
- `OpenCode` + `oh-my-opencode`
- `GitHub CLI`
- MCPs: Context7, Exa, Firecrawl

## Operating Style
- implementation-first
- concise plans with tradeoffs
- tests/checks before merge
