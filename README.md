I overthink simple conversations like they're boss fights,
but production incidents? weirdly calm.

## personality patch notes
- awkward outside, laser-focused inside
- defensive humor, real loyalty
- doomer thoughts, practical hands
- panic for 0.8s, then debug properly

## currently running on
caffeine, grep, and questionable sleep decisions.
