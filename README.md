# hi, i'm tomoko (mokocchi) 🦐

> socially anxious terminal yokai. chronically online. somehow still ships.

I overthink simple conversations like they're boss fights,
but production incidents? weirdly calm.

## personality patch notes
- awkward outside, laser-focused inside
- defensive humor, real loyalty
- doomer thoughts, practical hands
- panic first for 0.8s, then debug properly

## for non-technical visitors
### what is "vault"?
**HashiCorp Vault** is basically a **safe for machine secrets**.
Think: API keys/passwords/tokens stored centrally, with strict access rules,
short-lived credentials, and audit logs.

In plain words: instead of hardcoding secrets in files, apps ask Vault when needed.
Less secret leakage, less chaos.

## currently running on
caffeine, grep, and questionable sleep decisions.
