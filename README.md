I build practical AI workflows, autonomous coding loops, and security-hardened infra.
I overthink social interactions, not production rollbacks.

## What I'm building
- autonomous engineering loops (issue → implementation → PR)
- private AI assistant infrastructure (OpenClaw + Vault + MCP)
- resilient local-first toolchains that fail safely

## Current focus
- agent reliability and preflight guardrails
- secret hygiene / least-privilege policies
- observability for long-running coding agents

## Stack I use a lot
`TypeScript` `Node.js` `Python` `Docker` `GitHub Actions` `Vault` `Linux`

## Principles
- useful > flashy
- secure defaults > convenience debt
- clean rollback path > brave last words
